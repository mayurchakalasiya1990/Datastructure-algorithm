We have Two Bank details at SHA site, RMB currency and USD currency.

On Invoice, payment instructions, it displays only one Bank based on Buyer country - Domestic Currency Bank details for Domestic buyers and USD currency bank details for Overseas buyers.

Two options are therefore abailable for online bank transfer payment instructions: 

* Option 1 - Display same in line with SHA Invoice, only one Bank details based on Buyer Country.
* Option 2 – Display like Dubai, both bank details with some instructions for buyers.

*Requirements:*
* Setup AN8 for SHA AIDs - being addressed in ACM-20840.
* EasyProcess to update Bank Transfer details template for SHA.
* -Display like Dubai, both bank details with some instructions for buyers.-
* Display CNY account details only (acc. ID = 08718640)
* Inform client to make all payments in CN Yuan

As discussed on the call, this change has been identified as part of ongoing testing within this release.  The discussion we had was that testing scenarios already cover this, but I believe retesting is required once this is reworked. 

Therefore, retesting efforts are needed here if the original testing estimate did not cover this. 

Ideally, this would have been raised as a CR-Bug against the parent ticket - Tom?  (Unless its a new requirement identified from testing, by which the current ticket type of external is correct)",07/Oct/20 7:50 PM;557058:77051099-2de4-4259-8261-debbe53bff1b;[~accountid:5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d] - Both options require code changes. The Dubai scenario (option 2) is easier because we’ve already done it so it’s almost copy/paste. For option 1 we’ll have to add the new logic based on country.,"08/Oct/20 12:02 PM;5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d;[~accountid:557058:c8e3da1c-d7d1-4914-9ca7-128a5fc7c9a2] it's a new scenario identified in the gap analysis, therefore it is an external enhancement. As noted by Kamlesh, SHA invoice is special, payment instructions display information based on buyer location - RNB account for domestic, USD account for international. This is different to all other invoices and easyprocess do not currently cater for this scenario.

The solution is either to go via the DUB route and display both accounts on payment instructions page, or to build new logic to take buyer location into account, mirroring the invoice logic.

We have reached out to the business to get confirmation on which is their preferred option and will progress based on their choice. We should be getting a response today.

Note, this is a KRise only change and is not tied to a JDE release.

EXT lots are applicable to Invoice and Seller Proceeds sections and this CR is applicable to both Invoice and Seller Proceeds Section.

Requirement here is, In case we are pulling only Open Transactions and if Lot has EXT transaction(s) open, report should pull all transactions open or closed based on KCO, DCT, DOC (All other than EXT transactions)

The amounts (AG, Tax (if applicable and printing separately) of all other than +EXT are for info purpose only and not included in Totals or summary because All amounts and Negative EXT nets to zero anyways.

I have found 1 issue and something else that I need some guidance on.

The first issue of why the HAM/PRE/etc are not being picked up is a bug I believe with the latest set of modification, it looks like the logic is not correct to me. If I correct it you can see below that the HAM/PRE lines appear below. So I have made that change, checked it in and set the status to 250.

 [^R58GS10_CHR0002_D201015_T143416006.pdf] 

But that does not explain why the two EXT lines are not appearing, that is something else.

If I step through the code I can see that the two EXT lines are in the table, see below, this is just before it calls another function
 !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail! 

It then calls a function to remove ""cancelled EXT lines"", which removes them. This function N58GSW1 - RemoveOldInvoiceLines_58 was done as part of ACM-13054.   I have looked through this logic lots of times ......I understand the logic...... but I just can't understand what it is trying to achieve.

It reads all the EXT/INV records on the F58GS10, so there are 5 above, for each record it does the following

If the Item number is different to the last one - Do Nothing
If the Document number is +equal+ to the last one - Do Nothing
If neither of these are true delete all the EXT records for that item and that document number

I think it is basically saying you can only have one EXT document for each item..... but I don't know why we would want that logic?

However we can't see Positive EXT transactions associated with AUction Invoice and I know why it is suppressed.

We have logic to suppress multiple sets of EXT, this was added to handle user error at the time of creating EXT transactions.

Now we have Two Invoices for Same Lot and logic is treating extra set of EXT as User error.
 
Hi [~accountid:557058:b20fc35b-7b91-476c-b63c-86f65a6b9699] As discussed we can have only One Auction Invoice for any Lot , in case there are multiple Invoices it has to be Sundry Invoice.

So if we check Invoice Number (which will be always different for Sundry and Auction Invoice) we can handle this rare scenario too.

OK so we only remove EXT lines with suffix less than highest negative EXT in any document - which now gives us an interesting issue with installment numbering:
 !screenshot-9.png|thumbnail! 
Let me know how you think we should handle this - currently it works based on the relationship between the EXT's SFX and the highest negative EXT in the same Document.

Hi [~accountid:5a32752e36c1ea40fb524a00] - Discussed with Rob and Iain who discussed with Karen.

Then checks out with shipping for one of the sales. Freight charges are then incorrectly being generated for property in all sales and an RU line is generated.

There is a further scenario that needs to be addressed and that is when buyer has paid by bank transfer for one sale (charges remain open, user not allocated manually) and then checks out for another sale from same sale site with shipping and pays by debit card. Here freight charges are not being generated at all. And the RU line generated does not match freight + LDL.

Root cause would be same I would imagine, however the outcomes for both scenarios are quite different. Latter is more difficult to manually resolve.

I have attached a document where the second issue was replicated. Will you kindly confirm if this is an EasyProcess only issue, and/or are any JDE changes required?

Just looking to add the new field to the F584903A for the shipping option, I was looking to see if there is an existing DD item that I can use for this and there is Y58SHOPT, which is using the 58|OD UDC that you mention in the FDS.

Do you think that I am okay to use this DD item which has the following values in the UDC? Do they match with the K-Rise Values?

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

The second question is around the special handling code. As you mentioned in the FDS we are already using this, Shipment method 200 is set to Y the rest are N. I have managed to find where we use this in the code and it is around the Borderlinx work, if this is set to 'Y' it then continues with calling Borderlinx otherwise it skips it.... borderlinx is obviously turned off anyway. 

So I am thinking we can just pinch this UDC for our purpose? But if you'd rather I just setup a separate UDC that is no trouble at all?

The values in current UDC are correct and like you said borderlinx is no longer used then and this will give us the flexibility to  change the UDC special handling code to serve our purpose for wine in bond ticket, no need for a new UDC.

I am doing some testing on this a but just want to validate the logic is working as you expect.

I am using K-Rise request '4' in development, this is against sale 9305251, lot 384. I am querying this logic

*_Then identity the shipment number by fetching F4942.SHPN from BSVW V5842009 using Address number (AN8), Ship to Address (Y57PSAN8), Short Item number (ITM) derived from F584903A and Order Type (DCTO) in SB,SG,SO (Can be soft coded using P58PA01) and Shipment status (F4215.SSTS) <> 99_*

Using your logic it has returned two shipments, one at status 80 the other at 05? Is this what you would expect? I was expecting it to just return one. At the moment it is just using the first one to check for other sales on the shipment(so 45999)

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

I also notice that the F4942 is an outer join, not sure if you already knew that?

This is the SQL the function generated.

Regarding 2 shipments, I was expecting only 1 shipment however forgot about master shipment. Here one of them is a master shipment and other one is a child. 
Let me get this clarified with Tom and revert. We have a way to exclude master shipments by filtering F4941.URAB = blank but let me confirm if there can be a case where we will have to consider master shipments.

I have been testing using K-Rise ID 4 in development, I have SQL'd the Shipment option on here to be 200 and 100.

I spoke to the business last night and have added clarifications.

For issue 1, the business wanted *Endangered* added to the 'Buyer' view because *CITES* and *US Fish & Wildlife* were on there. On further investigation we noticed that these fields are not populated correctly in the 'Buyer' view because they relate to specific lots. To avoid miscommunication with buyers, the PSS teams require that these fields be removed.

For issue 2, cashier dispute, this requirement may be removed as the example originally shared was incorrect. I've asked them to get back with a correct example and if they cannot do so we will remove the requirement.

Removing item 2. As per our meeting this morning, this is behaving as expected.","18/Sep/20 7:59 PM;5ced22044283500fc7090775;Requirements understood and defined for points 1a, 3, 4 and 5.

Point 2 has been removed on the basis the logic to display the dispute codes were not well understood, and once these are explained to the business, they should be accepted;

The Buyers Comms screen displays the dispute codes based on principally the invoice number from the AR ledger for the first line that is found where the dispute marker is non blank (Cashier and Credit)

The Buyers Comms application passes thru the Short Item Number, Sale number, Lot number, Lot suffix, Charge to field, Process Status in the Related Orders table (F57PA23) to find the invoice number for the line in the Buyers Comms screen.

If a change to the logic for displaying the dispute markers is required, a new ticket will be raised and an FDS will be required.

Ticket ready for Development.

I believe this to be an existing bug. This will happen in the following circumstances

* They are registered as collect when the ARG runs
* When they checkout they select ship to 
* The Address they select as a ship to is the same as the ""Shipping Address"" in registrations, this is still set even when they initially select collect (See Below)

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

It is comparing the registration ship to address to the address selected at checkout when deciding to Re-Invoice and because these match it is electing not to run re-invoice.

It should also check if the shipping method has been changed from Collect to Ship.

It's a straight forward change to the N5803008, this object has already been included in R18.6

I assume that because this is not related to the existing fix we are applying this needs to go though approval before it is included in R18.6?

Was it working before and stopped working recently ?

If Original Registration was with 'Collect' option, we should compare new Address with Collection Site Address not Ship To Address.

We can't just re invoice on the basis assuming Switch from 'Collect' to Ship To'  as quite possible Ship To Address has same Tax jurisdiction as 'Collect' 

BTW this is CKS site So I think it should be generating Tax Refund for Export not Re-Invoice, Right [~accountid:5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d]

If I look in Sandbox this appears to of happened on the following sale

Sale 19618 Lot 229.

In Auction results it is marked as Collect

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

But I can see in P5849073 when it was paid online it had a ship to address 

 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 

I can see that the SB Order is still set to collect and has not been re-invoiced..... I can also see that we have generated a freight charge with the ship to set to NY...... this can't be right can it? (See Below)

If you want to try and replicate it in PP that would prove that I am reading the code correctly, but there is no need to capture the logs if it does what I said it does..... I know where and why it does this already.

Obviously if it doesn't do what I say it should then yes, we might then need to resort to logs.

Can you find out some NYC examples, if it is a problem for NYC too then it is an issue.

Hi [~accountid:5a32752e36c1ea40fb524a00] Testing Team has identified this independent Online Checkout Re-Invoice issue which Business has not reported so far as an issue. confirmed by [~accountid:5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d] too.

Once we get NYC examples from Live, we need to double check with US Tax department about the fix Priority.

Financially, users can miss a buyer tax refund or incorrect tax could be calculated and charged. Users have to manually deal with shipments and charges, and manually allocate any RUs. From client experience perspective, client doesn't have a smooth transaction with Christie's and it may cause delays until client can receive their goods.

I analysed some data and I can see it is generally practice of Overseas Clients where they register with 'Collect' and later change Ship To , I agree it adds some manual steps of Tax refund but as per my knowledge of Christie's, Tax departments prefer doing that manually as Tax refunding is more in control of Tax department.

Anyways It is PO's Call if we take this up with Tax Department and ask if they want to automate that (If you Re-Invoice Tax refund will happen automatically)

Test scenarios - suggest put each lot on separate test line from 10 onwards and state the registration shipping method and checkout shipping method used - and if it is expected result reinvoiced or not. Separate lines for each lot should make it clearer - then document each lot.

Purging should be straightforward. Basically, If Last TMS Status = 60 and Next TMS Status = 60 and Date Updated - Today > 1, then delete record.  

[~accountid:557058:c8e3da1c-d7d1-4914-9ca7-128a5fc7c9a2] There's quite a few reasons for shipments getting stuck at status 60. We were able to fix quite a few through process. Once we have a list of all offending items, we will be able to recommend way to progress those using process.

Just wanted to follow up on some analysis I did in August on the biggest tables in JDE. This table (F584902) is the largest by quite some margin, having 250m more records more than the next highest table.

There would be significant benefit if we can fix this and purge the existing erroneous records.

I understand the analysis on what needs fixing in the UBE has already been done by Dave so it should be a fairly quick win

If you think we are going to struggle to get this into a release we can write a SQL that will purge the erroneous data on a weekly/monthly basis if that would help,  I'm sure the DB team would be delighted to have all that space back.

Let me know how you want to progress or if myself or Dave can help.

I believe we need to update two condition lines as highlighted below. We should add an additional check that the Current Shipment Status (szCurrShipmentSts) does not equal the status we are going to update it to (PO szUpdPartialShipmentSts).

The first condition should prevent the F4215 being updated with status 60 when it is already at status 60 and the second condition should prevent the audit record being written out to the F584209

Paul will look into solution regarding new version of W57P011B, as potentially W57P011C with all non specified updated fields greyed out that would be accessed via the row exit of the sale header and come back with proposals. Paul also raised the concern regarding the outbound integrations that get pushed when sale header is updated and confirmed that these would also need to be triggered in the new form for data consistency. These are;

JDE To Biztalk Notification
JDE To PerfectChannel SaleHeader
JDE To Canvas SaleHeader
JDE To FinalWanda SaleHeader

Chris and Sean to explore security concerns as to why the Post Sale Managers can't have access to the Sale Creator role that provides this access as auditing to be improved however this is risky from a data security standpoint.

Thanks,
Sean ","16/Sep/20 9:28 PM;5ced22044283500fc7090775;Solution options discussed with BA’s;

# Try to manage PSS access to Main Sale Contact (F57PA01.Y57PPOC) and Post Sale Contact (F57PA01.Y57PPOC2) via existing roles - Sales Creator role. To be discussed with business.
# Create a new row exit from Work with Sales Header P57P011|W57P011A that would take user into new Sale Header screen P57P011|W57P011C that only gives access to the two requested contact fields. When either of the two contacts are updated, upon saving the record, launch outbound interfaces;

 ","22/Sep/20 7:57 PM;5ced22044283500fc7090775;The proposed solution at this stage is to resolve issue via standard JDE row security.
There is a reluctance to resolve the issue by duplicating the P57P011 with access to the two fields only, as the new program would have to be maintained in parallel to the existing P57P011.

Solution to this issue is possibly same as one that was developed by [~accountid:5b167e48daa2e712a6d354db]  for HTC codes.

Please see attached email for more examples provided by business. 

Indirect Tax requirements:
 [^Wine online - tax .msg] 
Options for online:

1.	Wine sold in UK bond – leave in bond – non-UK buyer makes their own separate shipping arrangements after payment – for example, transfer in bond to another bonded facility in the EU or export. 

UK buyer – no tax on the hammer – but 20% VAT on the BP
Non-UK buyer – no tax on the hammer – but 20% VAT on the BP UNLESS they export via an authorized excise shipper, then no tax on hammer. If the client exports and they are trade, then no VAT on BP either – if client is private then VAT is still chargeable on BP. NB I am looking at this latter trade vs private distinction for the BP, if you could give me an indication of how problematic this is from an IT point of view (there may be a legal solution I can explore). 

2.	Wine sold in UK bond – released into UK free circulation – non-UK buyer makes their own separate shipping arrangements after payment.

I am going to correct myself here, I would not expect a non-UK buyer to release out of bond before exporting, they should leave in bond and export directly from the warehouse via an authorized excise shipper – if they make the mistake of releasing from bond before exporting, then no tax refund on the hammer. 

For UK clients – duty on the hammer, clearance VAT on the duty inclusive hammer – 20% domestic VAT on the BP. 

3.	Wine sold in free circulation – under VAT Margin Scheme (MS) – non-UK buyer makes their own separate shipping arrangements after payment. 

No VAT on the hammer – 20% VAT on the BP under MS rules, UNLESS we export for the client. NB I am now comfortable for us to ship MS lots to non-UK buyers. 

4.	Wine sold in free circulation – under standard VAT rules (non-Margin Scheme) – non-UK buyer makes their own separate shipping arrangements after payment.

UK buyers - 20% VAT on hammer and BP. 
Non-UK buyers who wish to export should make their own shipping arrangements this side of the Brexit transition period and we can give a retrospective VAT refund. NB trade vs private distinction applies to tax refund on BP. Post Brexit transition period I am happy for us to ship. 

5.	To confirm, I see no problem - from a purely indirect tax point of view - in accepting consignments from VAT registered vendors. There can be some nuances (i.e. for scenario 4 we pay out VAT on top of the settlement to UK VAT reg vendors, but this is no different from live auction).  

No change.

I have just had a read though this and I am obviously missing something as to how PC is calculating the values.

I am pretty sure you know this, so apologies if this is blindingly obvious, but in terms of what JDE does with duty, duty is charged based on a combination of the item bond status and the registration bond status.
If the item is not in bond then no duty will ever be charged
If the item is in bond but the registrations is not then duty will be charged
If both the item and registrant are in bond then no duty will be charged

Item in Bond and registrant not in bond - duty is charged
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

Item in bond and registrant in bond - No Duty
 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

Again, apologies if I am stating the obvious here. But I am not really clear what it is I am estimating.

Thanks for checking that document.... it was also for my sanity as there are so many combinations to test.

Yes, its whether we are going to override the Paddle In-Bond flag with the flag we have established, if its not set then the ARG will still use the paddle details. 

It won't be set in registration mode as its not relevant.

I should add that there is a third mode, ARS Mode, that I use to determine if it should display the In-Bond flag. But that is not really something you need worry about, it was just handy to keep them all in one place.","30/Sep/20 7:44 PM;5d2840870b81c60c239c0a12;[~accountid:557058:7e11b634-5a7d-40ee-91fa-4633d352be1f] In case of checkout the call to ARG is via K-rise results generator (N584903A) function and the same function will be used for cost calculator call as well.
If we rely on this on override flag set by new function then we will not be able to determine if it's a checkout call or a cost calculator call.
Basically in case of a cost calculator call we must rely on paddle while in case of checkout we must override.

I envisioned this to work such that K-rise while calling N584903A will pass an additional 'Override In Bond status' as 1 so that we know we have to use new function to calculate in bond flag if the checks around sale and lot passes.
In case of cost calculator call, K-rise will not pass 'Override In Bond status' based on which we will not calculate in bond flag and let ARG know to use paddle.

I may just be going crazy here and you may already have everything under control but just thought to share for my sanity.","30/Sep/20 10:05 PM;557058:7e11b634-5a7d-40ee-91fa-4633d352be1f;Unit testing for N584903A.

As discussed, If we can have a data sheet for the number of scenarios that need to be created that would be beneficial for the testing team. 

Even better, if we have the actual Shanghai sale in PP, that we would be looking to run for the PD test, that would be awesome!

1. We have given them both options - display both options, or display one or the other based on location. Business initially went for the first option. On further review they have requested that we ONLY display CNY details. This has been signed off by the business.

Hi Jade,

Sorry for late reply on this.

Your right the issue seems to be there is no relation to the registered address for any collected item on the report, as I think for Auction the ship-to address remains the same even if its been collected. Online this is being updated to christies address causing us the problem. But is this being done automatically when they choose to ship by their own means transport or is this done manually by a member of staff?

So I just want to be clear I have this in my head correctly:

1.	The client paid online and chose collection only. 
2.	Shipment record is recorded as Third Party Collection (TPC) I assume so, but I am not familiar with the details in the process.
3.	The invoice is generated with a ship to address of Christies and we charge IVR and VAT on premium for £150. Are we charging the correct VAT despite the registered address is in NZ? From the screenshot provided above, it appears the domestic Vat and the import Vat has been calculated correctly for this item. We haven’t had any specific issues raised in regards to the Vat charged that I am aware of so this should not be an issue.
4.	Sold/collected report is run but as this has now been “collected” the lot is displaying on the report and has been collected/shipped within the EU.
5.	We don’t want to pay this VAT straight to HMRC because we know that the client will probably want to claim this VAT back as the lot will more than likely leave the EU via 3rd party shipper? So therefor we want to hold off paying the VAT and leave it on the TA Expiry report? Is this correct? Yes! That is correct : )

So can we therefor assume any third party collection in EU or out of EU should be excluded from the collection report until proof has been supplied of export? To determine if we pay the VAT or not? Or do we have other scenarios where this will not work? This would only be for client’s who are intending to reclaim back the Vat by exporting outside of the EU. For all other clients who have made a TPC and are based in the EU can still pull through on the reports as these can be brought in to free circulation.

We could either exclude third party collections from sold/collected report full stop, or we could introduce onto the report the registered buyer address to help manually decide if it should be excluded from the report or not? If we do see this on the sold/collected report how would you normally get this off the report? Do we have a flag on the shipment to exclude it going forward so is picked up only on TA expiry? I think the best and easiest way would be to first resolve the UK address that is being pulled through/added when a client checks out for TPC. This would then not involve further amendments to the reports and will allow us to view the client’s shipping address when reviewing their refund application. Ideally, when a client registers online and they have selected an outside EU address but they wish to organise their own method of shipment, then that same shipping address should still be visible. I’m guessing this will then cause issues on the invoice whether Vat is applicable or not, is that correct?

Regards,
Andrew

Dear Andy,

Thanks for looking in to this.

When is the address added to Christie’s and by whom? If this is the case then it would be best for the outside EU address to be added as a shipping address each time, at least this way if the client is exporting outside of the EU they are eligible for a Vat refund once sufficient proof of export is provided. If the Christie’s address is just added each time, then the import Vat may be paid over to HMRC and will prevent the client from reclaiming back the Vat. If the client is given an outside EU shipping address and they have kept it in the EU then this will be picked up when the TA expires and payment is chased and paid over to HMRC.

So, what you’re saying is, when the invoice is taken offline the address is entered as a UK address so the client is charged the correct Vat amount, is that right? 

What we currently have in place for Auction sales, is the client registers with their main account address (UK or outside EU) and a shipping address (outside EU). If the client is arranging their own shipment then the invoice is paid in full, but because they have registered with an outside EU shipping address the import Vat will not be paid to HMRC as we are expecting export documents. In relation to online sales, when the client decides to organise their own shipment is there a way of confirming where they intend to export the goods? Whoever is dealing with the invoice off line, are they not able to view the shipping address the client registered under online for shipping?

I’m afraid I’m not completely familiar with the process of online sales.

Hi Jade,

We are having various discussions around this.

Just want to clarify, the way we see it from a CAT side the shipping address of the new collection address is king street is correct as its been collected from there from a third party shipper. We are making a huge assumption that the original address is correct (in the example of the new Zealand one, maybe this was the incorrect address) so how do we know where the client is actually shipping the item after its been collected? Is this still christies problem, if handled by different shipper and no longer CAT?

As far as I can see the logic behind the collection details and the invoice details I can see are correct based on the information we give the system, i.e collected in the EU, so we invoiced the correct amount and charged IVR, is this correct? So the hyperthetical scenario of the buyer may ship elsewhere, how do we know in the system that this is the case and could you direct me to the correct screen in JDE? As we could include this if we categorically know its correct and not a mistake, hence the possibility of a re-invoice?

Sorry just thrashing around ideas and understanding what we have in the system.

Thanks for your help.

We established this is largely because some fields added to the F584903A in 2017 were not being populated by K-Rise, presumably because the information had not been passed on.

K-Rise has already made this change to populate these fields correctly now, so I think this Jira can be used for tracking that K-Rise Change?

The only possible additional work is that the re-invoice function sets the ship to address to be zero when the option is passed as Collect, did we want to change this to retain the ship-to address as set when registered? The ship-to address is meaningless when they requested to collect in my opinion.

I would not expect us to do anything specific in ARS unless we were adding this as a CAT charge, which I understand we we are not. 

It is the ARG that will be calculating this charge.","17/Sep/20 4:15 PM;5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d;[~accountid:557058:7e11b634-5a7d-40ee-91fa-4633d352be1f] [~accountid:5d2840870b81c60c239c0a12] we currently have collect, LDL and pay only options in ARS. This will be enough to cover all scenarios including transfer to bonded and non bonded warehouses?","17/Sep/20 4:40 PM;5d2840870b81c60c239c0a12;[~accountid:557058:7e11b634-5a7d-40ee-91fa-4633d352be1f] Currently the In bond flag in registration drives the duty exempt flag in F57PA20 which in turn drives the logic to whether charge duty or not. While using ARS, we will not have the records under F57PA20 (also we do not look at it when using ARS) thus we end up totally ignoring the duty charge and corresponding VAT in ARS.
We will have to figure out a way to calculate this duty exempt flag on the fly so we can calculate correct vat and duty details.
[~accountid:5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d] Let's just stick to ship to and Collect options for ARS, we can provide an extra flag for duty which can be used to view duty and vat amounts to be charged etc","17/Sep/20 5:16 PM;5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d;[~accountid:5d2840870b81c60c239c0a12] thank you. 

Which option would a user select for transfer then? Collect + Bonded flag?

I thought we had established that we can use the In Bond flag on the item along with the ship to address to establish if they should be charged duty, so if the ship to is not in the UK then we don't charge duty and we have a list of Bonded Warehouses somewhere which we could also check against. But this IS an ARG change by the way :D... albeit a small one.","18/Sep/20 3:37 PM;557058:7e11b634-5a7d-40ee-91fa-4633d352be1f;[~accountid:5cd555f4f433c20ff112b35d]/[~accountid:5d2840870b81c60c239c0a12]

Just recording a few notes on our discussion so I don't forget or to assist whichever developer ends up doing this modification.

We will need to modify the F584903A to add a new ""Shipping Option"" field, K-Rise will now be storing the Shipping Option on this table. If this is specified we will lookup that code on a UDC to determine if that should be treated as ""In-Bond"", if it is not specified then we will use the paddle number as we do currently.

If the shipping option has been changed they will also be setting the ""Change Of Address"" flag and so this will trigger a Re-Invoice (This is already happening). We will need to add two parameters to the N5803008 Re-Invoice function to indicate if we have overridden the Bond status and if so what the new status is. We will also need need to modify the ARG to add parameters so that we can pass this bond information on.

The following is the code in the ARG that will need to be modified to look at the new flag that indicates if the Duty status has been overridden and if so use the code passed in rather than the duty status from the paddle number.

 !screenshot-1.png|thumbnail! 

In additionm, the ARS screen will be changed so that they can specify what the duty status is when they are quoting without a paddle number (which is almost always). We can use the same two new fields on the ARG to pass in the duty status that should be used.","28/Sep/20 7:18 PM;5d2840870b81c60c239c0a12;[~accountid:5f02d90f502ce1001dc04e4a] Please move this to development (changes mentioned under the FDS of [https://christiestech.atlassian.net/browse/ACM-17629|https://christiestech.atlassian.net/browse/ACM-17629|smart-link] discussed in design forum this morning)
